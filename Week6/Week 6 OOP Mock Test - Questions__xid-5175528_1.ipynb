The club has regular members who can take regular dance classes organised by the club. The club also has 2 competition teams (novice and advanced) who represent the school to compete in national competitions. \n","\n","There are specific requirements for each category (regular members, novice team members, and advanced team members) to be qualified for their category. Your program has to \n","\n","1. obtain and record information from members, \n","\n","2. check if they have met those specific requirements.\n","\n","### Tasks\n","\n","- Collect the following information from all members:\n","    - Name\n","    - Gender\n","    - CID number\n","    - Email\n","    - Check if the person has purchased membership. If no, tell the person that he/she needs to purchase a membership on https://www.imperialcollegeunion.org/ to take classes at a discounted price.\n","\n","\n","- Collect the following information from a Novice in addition to what is obtained from any member:\n","    - Number of years hip hop dance experience the person has (cannot be negative number)\n","    - Preferred style (Old school, Urban, Popping, Locking, Breaking, others)\n","    - Check if he/she is a member.
