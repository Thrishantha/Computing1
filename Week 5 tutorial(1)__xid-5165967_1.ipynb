Feel free to expand beyond the information given above (I don't own any pets so I don't know much about how to look after them)! If you would like you can even create a separate set of classes to account for employees at the pet hotel. Think about how you would title them i.e. part-time, full-time, manager. Also think about how you would keep track of their pay and the work they've done or the pets they are responsible for."

Write an object oriented code that asks the customer to enter how much he/she wants to deposit and then gives out the balance at the end of one year in each bank.

    "In a given department, the default criterion to pass an exam is to secure an average grade of more than 50. Average is calculated using the midterm and final exam marks. There are two special student types called DE and IDE. They have two diffent marking systems. DE students get letter grades, A, B, C, and D for average marks (>= 70), (>70 and >= 60), (>60 and >=50), and (>50) respectively. IDE students get 'outstanding', 'excellent', 'good', and 'satisfactory' for average marks (>= 80), (>80 and >= 70), (>70 and >=50), and (>50) respectively. Use inheritance and polymorphism concepts to develop an object oriented code to generate the grade after a user inputs the midterm and final exam marks for any type of student. "
