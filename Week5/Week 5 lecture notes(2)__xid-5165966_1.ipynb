    "Now you can see how nested **inheritance** can be very useful to design complex class structures. In fact when we use module like \"math\", \"random\", we do the same thing. For instance, when we use the command *from math import sin*, we inherit the things we can do with *sin* in the *math* module. Since inheritance is an extremely useful tool when you design complex codes including classes, practice using it in different class structures.\n",
