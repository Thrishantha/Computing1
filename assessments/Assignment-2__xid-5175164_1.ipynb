    "#### Answer all questions\n",
    "** This assignment carries 60% of the final mark.**\n",
    "\n",
    "* This is an open book Python coding assignment. \n",
    "* You are allowed to submit upto 5 attempts on Black Board (Click Assignment-2 and follow instructions)\n",
    "* Please submit your answers as one Jupyter notebook file with code cells or a zip file of separate Python codes for each question. \n",
    "* Each Jupyter Notebook cell should run on its own. Do not assume availability of variables in the memory from previous cells.\n",
    "* Note that you will get marks for your correct attempts even if the code gives errors for some lines.\n",
    "* Maximum marks awarded for each sub question are shown within [$~$] \n",
    "* To earn full marks, your answer should be explained fully and clearly using comments in the code or text in a \"markdown\" cell, the code should run, the algorithm should be accurate (no semantic errors), and the implementation should be efficient."

    "Two players, Jack and Billy, play a dice game. They will both start the game with £100.\n",
    "In each round, each player will roll 3 six sided dice each having numbers from 1-6. The person who has the higher score (add the number of the three dice) wins. The winner gets £10 from the other player. If they have the same score, both of them need to roll the dice again.\n",

    "### Question 1.1  **[10 marks]**\n",
    "Write a class called **player** that has methods to obtain the score after rolling 3-dice, to add £10 if the player wins and to substract £10 if the player loses.\n",

    "A robotics company designs legged robots and wheeled robots for agricultural applications. They have a user interface that allows potential users to enter details of their requirements. You have to develop an object oriented program to keep a track of these user requirements, inform custmers what can be made and what cannot be made, and provide an estimate of costs involved. \n",
